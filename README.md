# Stabber - Analog Circuit Video Game

This is an ambitious project that will make a video game completely out of 
analog circuit components and using only analog circuit logic.

Output of analog circuit will be a video signal that will be passed through
a composite or component cable and then to the TV.

## The Game

The game is called Stabber. 

It is a 2 player game controlled with a 2 joystick controller for each player.

The objective of the game is to stab the other player with your weapon.

If a player's avatar is stabbed, then that player is eliminated.

Last player standing is the winner.

One joystick controls the player's position, the other joystick controlls the player's weapon position.
